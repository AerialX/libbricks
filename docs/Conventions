Random Usage Notes
==================

 - Always use references where possible, and Pointer<>s or AutoPointer<>s when reseating is required.
 - Objects on stack / member variables are fine, Release()ing them is a no-op (Not really, but current implementation requires you to release/retain 2^31 times to break it). In fact, ObjectPools are often used on the stack RIAA style.
 - Use of new on objects isn't suggested, but it works fine. Either call the destructor manually or Release() them.
 - Set up constructors and destructors like normal. Use alloc or autoalloc as necessary to create objects (same syntax as C++ new).
 - Prefer operator overloading (==, >, <, etc) over equivalents such as EqualTo()

Naming Conventions
==================

 - Method names are always ProperCase(). So are functions. And class names.
