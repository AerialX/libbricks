Delegates and Events
 - Maybe hold on to functor references, and only copy const references. Or just screw it and use std::ref.
 - Needs a boost::bind now for arbitrary arguments.

Filesystem
 - Delete Recursive

IO
 - Text{Reader,Writer}
 - Network
 - Console, it was hacked together *really* badly.

Threading
 - TLS doesn't destruct thread data, add a static Thread::ThreadDestroyed event and such.
 - AtomicPointer<> class to wrap access to a class in mutex locks.

Misc
 - Reduce dynamic_cast's where possible
    - Shot myself in the foot there, forced Object to always virtual inheritence.

Audio
 - Needs a lot of work.
 - AudioCodec<T> can derive and implement Bricks::IO::Stream as well to expose a binary stream.
 - AudioCodec<Tdest, Tsrc> wrapper around codecs for sample conversion.
