Delegates and Events
 - Maybe hold on to functor references, and only copy const references. Or just screw it and use std::ref.
 - Needs a boost::bind now for arbitrary arguments.

IO
 - Text{Reader,Writer}
 - Network
 - Console, it was hacked together *really* badly.

Threading
 - TLS doesn't destruct thread data, add a static Thread::ThreadDestroyed event and such.
 - AtomicPointer<> class to wrap access to a class in mutex locks.

Audio
 - Needs a lot of work.
 - AudioCodec<T> could expose a binary Bricks::IO::Stream.

Misc
 - Add a SFINAE specialization of ReturnPointer<> for native types, where it just inherits from Pointer<> instead.
 - Crypto
 - Plugin architecture
 - An ImageResize class which runs scaling algorithms on GetPixel()
