Delegates and Events
 - Do them better.
 - Resync the C++0x version to the template version.

Filesystem
 - Delete Recursive

IO
 - Text{Reader,Writer}
 - Network
 - Console, it was hacked together *really* badly.

Threading
 - TLS doesn't destruct thread data, add a static Thread::ThreadDestroyed event and such.

Misc
 - Fix autoalloc, it's broken if the first base class isn't Object
