Delegates and Events
 - Maybe hold on to functor references, and only copy const references. Or just screw it and use std::ref.
 - Needs a boost::bind now for arbitrary arguments.

IO
 - Text{Reader,Writer}
 - Network
 - Console, it was hacked together *really* badly.

Threading
 - TLS doesn't destruct thread data, add a static Thread::ThreadDestroyed event and such.
 - AtomicPointer<> class to wrap access to a class in mutex locks.

Audio
 - Needs a lot of work.
 - AudioCodec<T> can derive and implement Bricks::IO::Stream as well to expose a binary stream.

Misc
 - Start separating namespaces into their own libraries (Bricks::Audio carries too much bulk)
 - Find a good build manager.
 - Decide on a keyword to #define as (*this), self is taken by ObjC. myself?
