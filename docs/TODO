Delegates and Events
 - Needs a boost::bind now for arbitrary arguments.

Filesystem
 - Delete Recursive

IO
 - Text{Reader,Writer}
 - Network
 - Console, it was hacked together *really* badly.

Threading
 - TLS doesn't destruct thread data, add a static Thread::ThreadDestroyed event and such.
 - AtomicPointer<> class to wrap access to a class in mutex locks.

Misc
 - Reduce dynamic_cast's where possible
    - Shot myself in the foot there, forced Object to always virtual inheritence.
